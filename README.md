### How do I get set up? ###

* Run in an IDE

If you want to run the examples in an IDE, such as Eclipse, you should
be able to copy the entire contents of any one of the chapter folders
into a project in the IDE, and then run the programs.

* Compile and Run on the command line

If you know how to compile programs on the command line, and if you have
clone the project, you can easily compile and run all the code.
Use the command line to compile into the directory 'out/production/Network/':

	javac *.java

You can then run the Server Test.
For example:

	java server.Server

And the client:

    java client.Client

* Dependencies 

    It's necessary import some libs. All jar files are in the directory 'resource/lib'.
